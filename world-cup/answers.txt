Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: As the number of simulations increased, the predictions became more accurate and consistent. The teams with higher FIFA ratings tended to have a higher chance of winning, which was reflected in the simulation results.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: The predictions start to stabilize and show consistent trends around 100,000 simulations. Therefore, after around 100,000 simulations, the predictions could be considered "good enough" while balancing computational cost.
